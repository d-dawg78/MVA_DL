#### Abstract:

In this project, we explore the field of musical genre recognition using lyrics. We first introduce a 10000 track dataset that spans 12 genres. The lyrics present in it are then classified using a multitude of popular NLP algorithms such as CNNs, Bidirectional LSTMs, and Bidirectional GRUs superimposed on pre-trained GloVe or fastText word embedding layers. We also report results obtained using a pre-trained BERT model. Our best model obtained an average test set accuracy of 70%. This result is close to those obtained by more elaborate audio-based classifiers on much smaller datasets. It also surpasses past benchmarks on lyrical genre recognition tasks.
